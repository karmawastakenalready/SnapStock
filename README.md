# SnapStock

Welcome to **SnapStock**, a static stock photo website created as a learning project to practice CSS and web development. This project is open for anyone to explore, use, or modify as a template for their own photo gallery or portfolio site.

## About
SnapStock is a lightweight, responsive website designed to display a collection of stock images in a clean and visually appealing grid layout. It was built to help me understand CSS concepts like Flexbox, Grid, media queries, and general styling, while keeping the HTML structure simple and accessible.

## Features
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to various screen sizes, from mobile to desktop.
- **Simple Gallery Layout**: Displays images in a clean, organized grid.
- **Minimalist Codebase**: Easy to understand and modify for beginners.
- **Static Site**: No backend or database, just HTML, CSS, and a sprinkle of JavaScript for minor interactivity.

## Getting Started
You can use SnapStock as a starting point for your own project or simply explore the code to learn more about CSS and front-end development.

### Prerequisites
- A web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
- A code editor (e.g., VS Code) if you want to modify the files.
- Basic knowledge of HTML and CSS (optional, but helpful).

### Installation
1. **Clone or Download**:
   - Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/karmawastakenalready/snapstock.git`
   - Or download the ZIP file and extract it.
2. **Open the Project**:
   - Navigate to the project folder and open `index.html` in your browser to view the site.
3. **Customize**:
   - Replace the images in the `images/` folder with your own photos.
   - Modify the CSS in `styles.css` to change colors, layouts, or other styles.
   - Update the HTML in `index.html` to add new sections or features.

## Usage
- **Learn CSS**: Dive into the `styles.css` file to see how the layout, responsiveness, and styling were implemented.
- **Use as a Template**: Replace the stock images with your own and tweak the design to create a personal gallery, portfolio, or showcase site.
- **Experiment Freely**: Fork the repo, add new features (e.g., filters, lightbox effects), or integrate it with a backend for dynamic content.
